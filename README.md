# Chat-Room using python


#Description

In this project, I have created a Basic Chat room using GUI. For creating connection between client and server i have used socket library, and for synchronization of the messages threading module. Used various Tkinter widgets like buttons, labels, scroll, text, etc. to create a basic UI for the application.
